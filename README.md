# Dinosour_servo_game

i build a Auto Play Chrome Dinosaur Game 🦖 , but here is a twist i put the servo motor on my space bar of the keyboard and connect it with the Joystick 🕹️ . Chrome Dinosaur Game 🦖 is being displayed on the screen .As i pressed the joystick🕹️, servo motor will rotate 60 degree on a spacebar( spacebar is got pressed) servo will hit the spacebar then our dinosour will jump.

Microcontroller that i have used is Arduino Nano.
